Profiles, as explained in the report, are sets of rules specifying what files, capabilities, or resources a program can access. To inhibit a the script /testa.sh to read
the file /test_file_to_read, we can create the following profile:

/testa.sh {

      /testa.sh rix,
      
      deny /test_file_to_be_read r,
      
      /{,**} rwlkm,

}

This profile must be placed in the /etc/apparmor.d directory of the system. To load the profile in enforce mode, the following commands should be run next as root:

a) sudo apparmor-parser-r /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.testa

b) sudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.testa

For graceful prompts and non-termination, we can set it to complain mode as well : aa-complain
